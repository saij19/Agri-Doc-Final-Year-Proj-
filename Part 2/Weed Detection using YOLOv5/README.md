# Weed Detection using Yolov5
Our aim for this final year project is to focus on the health of tomato plants and for that , next step is to be able to detect and classify commonly found weeds around tomatoes. Thus to make this work we have used the help of pre-trained model YOLOv5 which gave us an accuracy of almost 98%
